# CS-255-System-Analysis-and-Design

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
DriverPass is a system requested by our client for students peparing for driving exams. They can schedule driving times with a driving instructor, take practice tests and track their progress. 
The system made allowances for working offline and a connection to DMV to update the system when there are changes to regulations and tests. 
What did you do particularly well?
I felt that the UML Activity Diagrams were done quite well. I enjoyed doing them and felt they came out very well.
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would do more on the UML Class diagram. I feel as though there were other steps that could have been included, as well as, even though it wasn't required for the assignment, adding the methods.Without the 
methods, I feel as though the diagram is incomplete.
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
The users needs included the ability to work off line. I included an update step where the user logs in and the system updates automatically, including restarting the program and alerts for update failures.
The users needs are critical to consider in deigning the system because they have a vision of what they want and satisfaction with what they receive improves the trust in the company and team. 
How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I like to start with high level architecture and then refine the work to ensure I am capturing the client needs. Starting at a high level means making sure I have a clear understanding of the client vision
before I move to the details. Verifying with the client at each stage before implementing it helps the client to feel confidence in the work and that we know and understand the system they would like.
